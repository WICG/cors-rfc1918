  <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

  <em>This section is not normative.</em>

  Although [[RFC1918]] has specified a distinction between "private" and
  "public" internet addresses for over a decade, user agents haven't made
  much progress at segregating the one from the other. Websites on the public
  internet can make requests to internal devices and servers, which enable a
  number of malicious behaviors, including attacks on users' routers like those
  documented in [[DRIVE-BY-PHARMING]] (and, more recenly, [[SOHO-PHARMING]] and
  [[CSRF-EXPLOIT-KIT]]).

  Here, we propose a mitigation against these kinds of attacks that would
  require internal devices to explicitly opt-in to requests from the public
  internet.

  <h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

  The overarching goal is to prevent the user agent from inadvertantly enabling
  attacks on devices running on a user's local intranet, or services running on
  the user's machine directly. For example, we wish to mitigate attacks on:

  *   Users' routers, as outlined in [[SOHO-PHARMING]]. Note that status quo
      CORS protections don't protect against the kinds of attacks discussed here
      as they rely only on <a>simple methods</a> and <a>simple headers</a>. No
      preflight is triggered, and the attacker doesn't actually care about
      reading the response, as the request itself is the CSRF attack.

  *   Software running a web interface on a user's loopback address. For better
      or worse, this is becoming a common deployment mechanism for all manner of
      applications, and often assumes protections that simply don't exist (see
      [[AVASTIUM]] and [[TREND-MICRO]] for recent examples).

  <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

  <h4 id="example-deny-by-default">Secure by Default</h4>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc's routers have a fairly serious CSRF vulnerability which allows
    their DNS settings to be altered by navigating to
    `http://admin:admin@router.local/set_dns` and passing in various GET
    parameters. Oh noes!

    Happily, MegaCorp Inc's routers don't have any interest in requests from the
    public internet, and didn't take any special effort to enable them. This
    greatly mitigates the scope of the vulnerability, as malicious requests will
    generate a <a>CORS-preflight request</a>, which the router ignores. Let's
    take a closer look:

    Given `https://csrf.attack/` that contains the following HTML:

    <pre>
      &lt;iframe href="https://admin:admin@router.local/set_dns?server1=123.123.123.123"&gt;
      &lt;/iframe&gt;
    </pre>

    `router.local` will be resolved to the router's address via the magic of
    multicast DNS [[RFC6762]], and the user agent will note it as
    <a>private</a>. Since `csrf.attack` resolved to a <a>public address</a>, the
    request will trigger a <a>CORS-preflight request</a>:


    <pre>
      OPTIONS /set_dns?... HTTP/1.1
      Host: router.local
      <a>Access-Control-Request-Method</a>: GET
      <a>Access-Control-Request-External</a>: true
      ...
      Origin: https://csrf.attack
    </pre>

    The router will receive this `OPTIONS` request, and has a number of possible
    safe responses:

    *   If it doesn't understand `OPTIONS` at all, it can return a `50X` error.
        This will cause the preflight to fail, and the actual `GET` will never
        be issued.

    *   If it does understand `OPTIONS`, it can neglect to include an
        <a>`Access-Control-Allow-External`</a> header in its response. This will
        cause the preflight to fail, and the actual `GET` will never be issued.

    *   It can crash. Crashing is fairly safe, if inelegant.
  </div>

  <h4 id="example-opt-in">Opting-In</h4>

  <div class="example">
    Some of MegaCorp Inc's devices actually need to talk to the public internet
    for various reasons. They can explicitly opt-in to receiving requests from
    the internet by sending proper CORS headers in response to a
    <a>CORS-preflight request</a>.

    When a website on the public internet makes a request to the device, the
    user agent determines that the requestor is <a>public</a>, and the router
    is <a>private</a>. This means that requests will trigger a <a>CORS-preflight
    request</a>, just as above.

    The device can explicitly grant access by sending the right headers in its
    response to the preflight request. For the above request, that might look
    like:

    <pre>
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      <a>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</a>: https://public.example.com
      <a>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</a>: GET
      <a>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</a>: true
      <a>Access-Control-Allow-External</a>: true
      Vary: Origin
      Content-Length: 0
      ...
    </pre>
  </div>

  <h4 id="shortlinks">Navigation</h4>

  <div class="example">
    MegaCorp Inc. runs an internal link shortening service at `https://go/`, and
    its employees often email such links to each other. The email server is
    hosted at a <a>public address</a> in order to ensure that employees can work
    even when they're not at the office. How considerate!

    Clicking `http://go/*` links from `https://mail.mega.corp/` will trigger a
    <a>CORS-preflight request</a>, as it is a request from a <a>public
    address</a> to a <a>private address</a>:

    <pre>
      OPTIONS /short-links-are-short-after-shortening HTTP/1.1
      Host: go
      <a>Access-Control-Request-Method</a>: GET
      <a>Access-Control-Request-External</a>: true
      ...
      Origin: https://mail.mega.corp
    </pre>

    In order to ensure that employees can continue to navigate such links as
    expected, MegaCorp chooses to allow external requests:

    <pre>
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      ...
      <a>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</a>: https://mail.mega.corp
      <a>Access-Control-Allow-Methods</a>: GET
      <a>Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</a>: true
      <a>Access-Control-Allow-External</a>: true
      Vary: Origin
      Content-Length: 0
      ...
    </pre>

    MegaCorp's leak-prevention department is worried, though, that this access
    will allow external folks to read the location of any redirect that the
    shortener would return. They're more or less resigned to the fact that
    `https://go/shortlink` will leak, but would be sad indeed if the target
    (`https://sekrits/super-sekrit-project-with-super-sekrit-partner`) leaked
    as well.

    MegaCorp's shortlink engineers are careful to avoid this potential failure
    by returning CORS headers <em>only</em> for the preflight. The "real"
    navigation doesn't require CORS headers, and they don't actually want to
    support cross-origin requests as being CORS-same-origin:

    <pre>
      // Request:
      GET /short-links-are-short-after-shortening HTTP/1.1
      Host: go
      <a>Access-Control-Request-External</a>: true
      ...
      Origin: https://mail.mega.corp

      // Response:
      HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
      ...
      Location: https://sekrits/super-sekrit-project-with-super-sekrit-partner
    </pre>

    The navigation will proceed normally, but `mail.mega.corp` won't be
    considered CORS-same-origin with the response.

  <h2 id="framework">Framework</h2>

  An IPv4 address is a <dfn export local-lt="private">private address</dfn> if
  it matches the <a>private address space</a> defined in Section 3 of
  [[!RFC1918]], a <dfn export local-lt="local">local address</dfn> if it matches
  the "loopback" space (`127.0.0.0/8`) defined in section 3.2.1.3 of
  [[!RFC1122]] or the "link-local" space (`169.254.0.0/16`) defined in
  [[!RFC3927]], and a <dfn export local-lt="public">public address</dfn>
  otherwise.

  An IPv6 address is a <a>local address</a> if it matches the "Unique Local
  Address" prefix (`fc00::/7`) defined in Section 3 of [[!RFC4193]] or the
  "link-local" prefix (`fe80::/10`) defined in section 2.5.6 of [[!RFC4291]],
  and a <a>public address</a> otherwise.

  ISSUE(mikewest/cors-rfc1918#3): What does "private" mean in the context of
  IPv6?

  A <a>request</a> (|request|) is an <dfn export>external request</dfn> if
  any of the following are true, and an <dfn export>internal request</dfn>
  otherwise:

  1.  |request|'s <a for="request">current url</a>'s {{URL/host}} maps to a
      <a>private address</a>, and |request|'s <a for="request">client</a>'s
      <a>address space</a> is "`public`".
      
  1.  |request|'s <a for="request">current url</a>'s {{URL/host}} maps to a
      <a>local address</a>, and |request|'s <a for="request">client</a>'s
      <a>address space</a> is either "`public`" or "`private`".

  <h3 id="headers">Additional CORS Headers</h3>

  The <dfn export>`Access-Control-Request-External`</dfn> indicates that the
  <a>request</a> is an <a>external request</a>.

  The <dfn export>`Access-Control-Allow-External`</dfn> indicates that a resource
  can be safely shared with external networks.

  <h3 id="csp">The `treat-as-public-address` Content Security Policy Directive</h3>

  The <dfn>treat-as-public-address</dfn> directive instructs the user agent to
  treat a document as though it was served from a <a>public address</a>, even if
  it was actually served from a <a>private address</a>. That is, it is a
  mechanism by which private documents may drop the privilege to contact other
  private documents without a preflight.

  The directive's syntax is described by the following ABNF grammar:

  <pre dfn-type="grammar" link-type="grammar">
    directive-name  = "treat-as-public-address"
    directive-value = ""
  </pre>

  This directive has no reporting requirements; it will be ignored entirely when
  delivered in a `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header, or within
  a <{meta}> element.

  This directive's <a>initialization</a> algorithm is as follows. Given a
  `Document` or `global object` (|context|), a `Response` (|response|), and
  a `policy` (|policy|):

  1.  Set |context|'s <a>address space</a> to "`public`" if |policy|'s
      <a>disposition</a> is "`enforce`".

  <h3 id="feature-detect">Feature Detection</h3>
  
  To determine the address space in which a context finds itself, a simple enum
  value is added to {{Document}} and {{WorkerGlobalScope}}:

  <pre class="idl">
    enum AddressSpace { "local", "private", "public" };

    partial interface Document {
      readonly attribute AddressSpace addressSpace;
    };

    partial interface WorkerGlobalScope {
      readonly attribute AddressSpace addressSpace;
    };
  </pre>

  Both attributes' getters return the value of the corresponding {{Document}} or
  {{WorkerGlobalScope}}'s <a>address space</a> property.

<!-- Big Text: Integrations -->
<section>
  <h2 id="integrations">Integrations</h2>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  This document proposes a number of modifications to other specifications in
  order to implement the mitigations sketched out in the examples above. These
  integrations are outlined here for clarity, but the external documents are the
  normative references.

  <h3 id="integration-fetch">Integration with Fetch</h3>

  This document proposes a few changes to Fetch, with the following
  implications:

  1.  <a>Requests</a> whose <a for="request">client</a>'s <a>address space</a>
      is "`local`" are unchanged from status quo. They may continue to make
      requests to <a>public</a>, <a>private</a>, and <a>local</a> addresses as
      they do today.

      ISSUE(mikewest/cors-rfc1918#1): Chris Palmer suggests that we might want
      to change the proposal such that private services must always opt-in to
      being contacted by anyone other than themselves. That is, we'd force a
      preflight for all cross-origin requests to private servers, whether they
      come from public addresses, or private addresses.

  2.  <a>Requests</a> whose <a for="request">client</a>'s <a>address space</a>
      is "`private`" are allowed to fetch resources from <a>private</a> and
      <a>public</a> addresses as they do today, but may only request
      <a>local</a> resources if their <a for="request">client</a> is a
      <a>secure context</a> <em>and</em> a <a>CORS-preflight request</a> to the
      target origin passes a <a>CORS check</a>.

  3.  <a>Requests</a> whose <a for="request">client</a>'s <a>address space</a>
      is "`public`" are allowed to fetch resources from <a>public</a> addresses
      as they do today, but may only request <a>private</a> and <a>local</a>
      resources if their <a for="request">client</a> is a <a>secure context</a>
      <em>and</em> a <a>CORS-preflight request</a> to the target origin passes
      a <a>CORS check</a>.

  Note: UAs must not allow <a lt="secure context">non-secure</a>
  <a>public</a> contexts to request resources from <a>private
  addresses</a>, even if the private server would opt-in to such a request via
  a preflight. Making requests to <a>private</a> resources presents risks which
  are mitigated by ensuring the integrity of the <a for="request">client</a>
  which initiates the request. In particular, network attackers should not be
  able to trivially exploit an endpoint's consent to a non-secure origin.

  To those ends:

  1.  The <a>scheme fetch</a> algorithm should be adjusted to ensure that a
      preflight is triggered for all <a>external requests</a>. This might
      be as simple as changing the current "HTTP(S) scheme" block of the
      switch statement to the following:

      1.  If |request| is an <a>external request</a>, return the result of
          performing an <a>HTTP fetch</a> using |request| with the
          |CORS-preflight flag| set.

          Otherwise, return the result of performing an <a>HTTP fetch</a> using
          |request| with the |CORS-preflight flag| unset.

      Note: We do not set the |CORS flag| in this case, as we're dealing with
      either a same-origin request that has been tainted by something like a
      [[#dns-rebinding]] attack, a navigation, or a `no-cors` request. The
      preflight alone should be enough to mitigate the risks of such requests.

      Note: This will require a preflight for <em>every</em> request initiated
      from a <a>public address</a> that targets a <a>private address</a>. This
      includes navigations.

  2.  The <a>CORS-preflight fetch</a> algorithm should be adjusted to append
      an <a>`Access-Control-Request-External`</a> header for preflights
      triggered by <a>external requests</a>. For instance, the following could
      be executed after the current step 5:

      6.  If |request| is an <a>external request</a>:

          1.  If |request|'s <a for="request">client</a> is not a <a>secure
              context</a>, return a <a>network error</a>.

              Note: We don't need to touch the network to know that this request
              will be denied.

          2.  <a for="header list">Set</a>
              "<a>`Access-Control-Request-External`</a>" to "`true`" in
              |preflight|'s <a>header list</a>.

  3.  The <a>CORS check</a> algorithm should be adjusted to ensure that consent
      is explicitly granted via an appropriate
      "<a>`Access-Control-Allow-External`</a>" header in the response. For
      instance, the following could be executed before the current step 3:

      3.  If |request| is an <a>external request</a>:

          1.  Let |external| be the result of <a for="header list">parsing</a>
              "<a>`Access-Control-Allow-External`</a>" in |response|'s
              <a>header list</a>.

          2.  If |external| is not "`true`", return failure.

  4.  Finally, to mitigate the impact of DNS rebinding attacks (see
      [[#dns-rebinding]]), the <a>CORS-preflight cache</a> should be adjusted to
      distinguish between request types. For example, we could:

      1.  Add "<dfn export for="cache">request network type</dfn>" to each cache
          entry, and change the <a>cache match</a> algorithm to take it into
          account.

      2.  Populate <a>request network type</a> according to the nature of
          |request| in steps 7.12 and 7.14 of the current <a>CORS-preflight
          fetch</a> algorithm.

      3.  Change the <a>cache match</a> algorithm to take

  ISSUE: [[FETCH]] does not yet integrate the details of DNS resolution into the
  Fetch algorithm, though it does define an <a>obtain a connection</a>
  algorithm which is a good start. We'll need to think about things like Happy
  Eyeballs [[RFC6555]] to make sure that we perform the right checks depending
  on the IP address we actually connect to. For the moment, this document
  assumes that connection information is available in the <a>scheme fetch</a>
  algorithm. That might not be a reasonable assumption, in which case we'll
  need to revisit all of this.

  <h3 id="integration-websockets">Integration with WebSockets</h3>

  For the purposes of this specification, the <a>WebSocket handshake</a> is
  treated as a simple GET request. A <a>WebSocket handshake</a> whose client's
  public internet flag is set is allowed to proceed if and only if the client is
  a secure context <em>and</em> a <a>CORS-preflight request</a> to the target
  origin passes a <a>CORS check</a>.

  Assuming the preconditions are met, the WebSocket handshake proceeds as
  normal. This permits the mitigation to be implemented as a UA feature, without
  modification to [[RFC6455]].

  <h3 id="integration-html">Integration with HTML</h3>

  To support the checks in [[FETCH]], we store an <dfn>address space</dfn>
  on both {{Document}} and {{WorkerGlobalScope}} objects, which is set as
  follows during {{Document}} and {{Worker}} initialization:
  
  1.  Set the <a>address space</a> to "`local`" if the the resource used
      to instantiate the {{Document}} or {{Worker}} was was delivered
      from a <a>local address</a>, or from a URL whose <a for="url">scheme</a>
      is "`file`" (see [[#file-url]]).

  2.  Set the <a>address space</a> to "`private`" if the the resource used
      to instantiate the {{Document}} or {{Worker}} was was delivered
      from a <a>private address</a>.

  3.  Set the <a>address space</a> to "`public`" if the the resource used
      to instantiate the {{Document}} or {{Worker}} was was delivered
      from a <a>public address</a>.

  <div class="example">
    Assuming that `example.com` resolves to a <a>public address</a> (say,
    `123.123.123.123`), then the {{Document}} created when navigating to
    `https://example.com/document.html` will have its <a>address space</a>
    set to "`public`".

    If, on the other hand, `example.com` resolved to a <a>local address</a>
    (say, `127.0.0.1`), then the {{Document}} created when navigating to
    `https://example.com/document.html` will have its <a>address space</a>
    set to "`local`".

  <h3 id="file-url">Where do `file` URLs fit?</h3>

  It isn't entirely clear how `file` URLs fit into the public/private scheme
  outlined above. It would be nice to prevent folks from harming themselves by
  opening a malicious HTML file locally, on the one hand, but on the other, code
  running locally is somewhat outside of any sane threat model.

  For the moment, let's err on the side of treating `file` URLs as <a>local</a>,
  as they seem to be just as much a part of the local system as anything else on
  a loopback address.

  ISSUE: Reevaluate this after implementation experience.

  <h2 id="security-and-privacy-considerations">Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>

  <h3 id="user-mediation">User Mediation</h3>

  The proposal in this document only ensures that the device consents to access
  from the public internet. Users agents SHOULD ensure that the <em>user</em>
  consents to such access as well, as it might be in their interests to deny
  such access, even though the device itself would allow it.

  This mediation could be done via an explicit permission grant, via some sort
  of pairing ceremony a la
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password-authenticated_key_agreement">PAKE</a>,
  or any other clever interface which the user agent might devise.

  <h3 id="mixed-content">Mixed Content</h3>

  Note that the CORS restrictions added by the proposal in this document do not
  obviate mixed content checks [[!MIXED-CONTENT]]. Developers who wish to
  fetch <a>private</a> resources from <a>public</a> pages MUST ensure that the
  connection is secure. This might involve a solution along the lines of
  [[PLEX]], or we might end up inventing a new way of ensuring a secure
  connection to devices (perhaps the pairing ceremony hinted at above, or one of
  the ideas floated in [[SECURE-LOCAL-COMMUNICATION]]?). In either case,
  consenting to access by sending proper CORS is necessary, but not sufficient.

  Note: Doing something like the proposal here would make me more comfortable
  with relaxing the mixed content restrictions that prohibit unencrypted
  connections to loopback addresses. Right now, those aren't really subject to
  the kinds of concerns that drive most of [[MIXED-CONTENT]]'s decisions, but
  I'm reluctant to change Chrome's implementation without some protection for
  the local server and user.

  <h3 id="dns-rebinding">DNS Rebinding</h3>

  The mitigation described here operates upon the IP address which the user
  agent actually connects to when loading a particular resource. This check
  MUST be performed for each new connection made, as DNS rebinding attacks
  may otherwise trick the user agent into revealing information it shouldn't.

  The modifications to the <a>CORS-preflight cache</a> are intended to mitigate
  this attack vector.

  <h3 id="scope-mitigation">Scope of Mitigation</h3>

  The proposal in this document merely mitigates attacks against private web
  services, it cannot fully solve them. For example, a router's
  web-based administration interface must be designed and implemented to defend
  against CSRF on its own, and should not rely on a UA that behaves as specified
  in this document. The mitigation this document specifies is necessary given
  the reality of private web service implementation quality today, but vendors
  should not consider themselves absolved of responsibility, even if all UAs
  implement this mitigation.
